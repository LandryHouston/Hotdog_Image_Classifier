<h2 align="center">Overview</h2>

<p>

Welcome to the Hotdog or Not Classifier project! This repository implements a simple image classification solution using a sequential model to determine if an uploaded image contains a hotdog or not. Inspired by a Silicon Valley episode, the project includes a user-friendly Streamlit app for easy interaction. All of this was developed during a 6-hour hackathon.

<p>

The dataset comprises 3000 images, with 1500 featuring hotdogs captured from various angles and presentations, and the remaining 1500 images not containing a hotdog. You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/yashvrdnjain/hotdognothotdog#__sid=js0) or in the [data folder](/data/).

<h2 align="center">Streamlit Application</h2>

<p>

I built a user-friengly Streamlit app that allows the user to upload an image and the model will instantly predict whether the image contains a hotdog or not.

#### How to Use:

- Click on the "Browse files" button.
- Upload your image of choice.
- Get your results.

No more food identity crises. Let the app work for you!
